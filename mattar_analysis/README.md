# mattar_analysis
Implementation of the [Mattar 2016](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(16)30419-5.pdf) exponential integration model using the [forwardModel](https://github.com/gkaguirrelab/forwardModel) non-linear fitting platform.
run_mattar_analysis_on_MSU_face_data is a variant of a basic working version that was provided by Geoff Aguirre.
The folder also includes functionality that is not the Mattar analysis itself but that is used in the context of that analysis, for instance functionality to delineate retinotopic visual areas based on anatomy.
